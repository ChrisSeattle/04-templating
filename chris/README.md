This is refactoring the previous project work to utilize the Handlebars library and to use arrow functions. 


## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
The user needs to install these files in a location that can serve up HTML, CSS, and JS files. They need to use a browser envirnoment that is compatible with the aformentioned languages and can access these files. They also need to have internet connection to access the jQuery library at code.jquery.com and to the handlebars.js library at cdnjs.cloudflare.com.
